            Dogs have played an important role in the lives of humans for thousands of years, 
            not only as companions, but as working animals that help in a variety of ways. 
            In ancient times, dogs were believed to help with hunting and providing protection 
            to homes and livestock. 
            Today, dogs are a normal part of everyday life and most are considered furry members 
            of the family. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Service dogs, however, are not only loyal companions, but are highly trained working 
            dogs that make a tremendous difference in the lives of people with special needs. 
            An estimated 500,000 service dogs1 According to the American Kennel Association.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">What is a Service Dog? </h2>
        <p>
            Service dogs are defined by the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) as “dogs that are individually 
            trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities.” 
            To qualify as a service dog under the ADA, the dog must be trained specifically to 
            assist or respond to the person’s disability which can include a “physical, sensory, 
            psychiatric, intellectual, or other mental disability.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">What Legal Rights Do Service Dogs and Their Owners Have? </h2>
        <p>
            These trained dogs are considered working animals, not pets, and therefore, 
            service dogs are allowed in government buildings in accordance with the ADA. 
            This includes all businesses that serve the public such as restaurants or stores 
            and public places such as libraries and museums. Service dogs are also allowed 
            on public transportation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Although, airlines may have specific rules regarding where the dog sits, 
            but for the most part, the rules should be consistent with the ADA.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">How To Get a Service Dog</h2> 
        <p>
            There is no centralized organization that provides service dogs to people with disabilities. 
            Instead, there are various public and private organizations that train and assign dogs. 
            Often, these groups focus on a particular disability which allows them to efficiently 
            and effectively train dogs for service. 
        </p>
        <p>Training dogs is costly, and many organizations rely on private donations. 
            Moreover, training service dogs can take several months.
