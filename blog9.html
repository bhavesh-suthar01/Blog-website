        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">1. They chew for a reason</h2>
        <p>
            “The reason they are chewing on things is because they have incisors — front teeth — 
            that are always growing,” McCleery explained. “If they don’t chew on something, 
            their teeth are going to grow into their lower jaw and skull.” 
            To avoid that, squirrels will chew on anything that helps wear down their teeth.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">2. They are nature's gardeners</h2>
        <p>
            Squirrels have an important ecological role, especially in forest ecosystems, McCleery said.
            <br><br>
            “Their biggest contribution to the forest is in shaping plant composition. 
            They have a peculiar habit of taking seeds, which are their main source of nutrients, 
            and burying them. They bury them throughout the environment, and often, when they go back and look for them, 
            they forget where they are. When that happens, they are effectively planting seeds,” McCleery said.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">3. They have some zany behaviors that are entertaining to watch</h2>
        <p>
            Squirrels have some behaviors that may be puzzling to humans, McCleery said.
            For example, if you see a squirrel rubbing its face on an acorn, 
            that’s the squirrel marking the seed with its scent, increasing the chances it will find it later.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">4. They will tell you off</h2>
        <p>
            “If you’re in your backyard, walking across a college campus or through a park, you might hear squirrels. 
            They make a rolling chirping noise,” McCleery said. 
            As they make that noise, they may also rapidly flick their tails over their heads.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">5. There are many species of squirrel, and they come in lots of shapes, colors and sizes</h2>
        <p>
            “There are three squirrels commonly found in Florida. 
            The gray squirrel is smaller than the others and is gray in color. 
            The fox squirrel, on the other hand, is larger than the gray squirrel, 
            and is the most variably colored mammal in North America,” McCleery said.
