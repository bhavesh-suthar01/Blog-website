        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">Are cats less domesticated than dogs? 
            Are they becoming more domesticated over time?</h2>
        <p>
            Cats are far more similar to their wild ancestors than dogs are to wolves, 
            so dogs are in that sense the more domesticated of the two species. 
            As they adapted to living alongside humans, cats became more sociable with one 
            another and much more accepting of people, but there is no evidence that they have 
            changed much more than that over the past few thousand years.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">Will cats, which require meat, 
            eventually evolve to eat a broader array of foods as dogs do?</h2>
        <p>
            Cats and dogs belong to a group of mammals known as Carnivora, 
            and the wild ancestors of both species dined primarily on meat. 
            Recent DNA analyses indicate that over the course of their evolution, dogs have acquired more 
            copies of the so-called amylase gene, which makes an enzyme that helps to break down starch. 
            Having more copies of this gene has allowed dogs to eat a more omnivorous diet. 
            In contrast, the cat family, known as Felidae, lost the genes that encode several key 
            enzymes—including those that manufacture vitamin A, prostaglandins and the amino acid taurine—early in its evolution.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">Why do cats purr?</h2>
        <p>
            Cats purr because they have something to say, which roughly translated is 
            “please keep still and pay attention to me.” Kittens purr to persuade their mothers to keep on nursing them, 
            and pet cats purr when they want to be stroked. 
            The vibrations emanating from the purr certainly have a calming effect on people. 
            Yet sick cats will also purr as a cry for help. So purring doesn’t always mean “I’m happy.”
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">How do they purr?</h2>
        <p>
            The purr is an unusual vocalization, made by rattling the vocal cords together rather than vibrating 
            them by pushing air past them, which is how cats—and humans—generate all their other vocal sounds. 
            That’s why cats can purr when they’re breathing in and breathing out. Most species of wildcats can purr, including the cheetah. 
            The exceptions are the big cats—lion, tiger, jaguar and leopard—whose voice boxes are modified so that they can roar.
            How can you get a cat to love you?
        </p>
        <p>
            Cats naturally feel affection for those who feed, look after and play with them, 
            although they don’t always make that obvious. Trust can be harder to win because some cats are just nervous. 
            One trick is to always allow the cat to approach you rather than forcing yourself on the cat when you feel like it. 
            When the cat does approach, reward it with a few treats and let it leave as soon as it wants to.
