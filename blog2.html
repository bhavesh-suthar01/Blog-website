        <p>
            Sloths—the adorable and lethargic animals living in treetops—depend on the health and survival of Central and South American tropical forests. They spend much of their lives in the canopy, snoozing and remaining hidden from predators.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">1. Why are sloths slow?</h2>
        <p>
            Sloths have an extremely low metabolic rate, which means they move at a languid, sluggish pace through the trees. 
            On average, sloths travel 41 yards per day—less than half the length of a football field!
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">2. Are female sloths good mothers?</h2>
        <p>
            Female sloths give birth to one baby a year after a gestation period of six months. 
            The baby sticks with the mother for about six months, grasping its mom’s belly as she moves through the trees. 
            This is an important bonding period that helps the offspring learn and develop. 
            When the sloth leaves its mom after about six months, it adopts part of its mother’s range, 
            continuing to communicate with the parent through calls.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">13. How often do sloths sleep?</h2>
        <p>
            Sloths snooze for about 15 hours per day. That leaves only nine hours to lumber through the trees. 
            They maintain a low body temperature of about 86°F-93°F and move in and out of shade to regulate their body temperature.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">4. What do sloths eat?</h2>
        <p>
            Sloths munch on leaves, twigs and buds. Because the animals don’t have incisors, 
            they trim down leaves by smacking their firm lips together. 
            A low metabolic rate means sloths can survive on relatively little food; 
            it takes days for them to process what other animals can digest in a matter of hours.
