        <p>
            Tigers are the largest felines in the world and as such, many cultures consider the tiger to be a symbol of strength, 
            courage and dignity. 
            The tiger is one of the twelve Chinese zodiac animals, and those born in the "Year of the Tiger" 
            are thought to be brave, competitive and self-confident.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">Do all tigers have stripes?</h2>
        <p>
            Most tigers have the characteristic orange fur with black or brown stripes, but these markings vary between subspecies. 
            For example, the very large Siberian tiger has pale orange fur with few stripes, 
            while the smaller Sumatran tigers in the Sunda Islands have dark, thickly striped fur.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">Where tigers live and what they eat</h2>
        <p>
            Wild tigers live in Asia. Larger subspecies, such as the Siberian tiger, tend to live in northern, 
            colder areas, such as eastern Russia and northeastern China. 
            Smaller subspecies live in southern, warmer countries, such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Myanmar, 
            Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia.
            All tigers are carnivores. Most of a tiger's diet consists of large prey, such as pigs, deer, rhinos or elephant calves. 
            To kill their prey, tigers clamp down on the animal's neck with their jaws and suffocate the animal. 
            The tiger's canine teeth have pressure-sensing nerves, so it knows exactly where to deliver a fatal bite to 
            its prey, according to the WWF.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">The tiger life</h2>
        <p>
            Tigers are solitary creatures; they like to spend most of their time alone, roaming their massive territories looking for food. 
            According to the San Diego Zoo, the Siberian tiger has the largest range; its territory spans more than 4,000 
            square miles (10,000 square km). Tigers mark their territory by spraying a mix of urine and scent gland 
            secretions onto trees and rocks. 
            They also scratch marks into trees with their claws.
