            Zebras are famous for their contrasting black and white stripes – but until very recently no one really 
            knew why they sport their unusual striped pattern. 
            It’s a question that’s been discussed as far back as 150 years ago by great Victorian biologists 
            like Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since then many ideas have been put on the table but only in the last few years have there been 
            serious attempts to test them. 
            These ideas fall into four main categories: Zebras are striped to evade capture by predators, 
            zebras are striped for social reasons, zebras are striped to keep cool, or they have stripes to avoid attack by biting flies.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">What’s the advantage of zebra stripes?</h2>
        <p>
            Could stripes help zebras avoid becoming a predator’s meal? There are many problems with this idea. 
            Field experiments show that zebras stand out to the human eye when they’re among trees or in grassland 
            even when illumination is poor – they appear far from camouflaged. 
            And when fleeing from danger, zebras do not behave in ways to maximize any confusion possibly caused by 
            striping, making hypothetical ideas about dazzling predators untenable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Worse still for this idea, the eyesight of lions and spotted hyenas is much weaker than ours; 
            these predators can only resolve stripes when zebras are very close up, at a distance when they can 
            likely hear or smell the prey anyway. So stripes are unlikely to be of much use in anti-predator defense.
