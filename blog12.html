        <p>
            Studying trends in data can tell us a lot about the success (or lack thereof) of a management program. 
            Below is a look at the 2016-2017 deer harvest numbers and trends for Oklahoma, Texas, the Southeast and the nation. 
            You can evaluate where you are along the management continuum in terms of meeting your population management 
            goals by comparing these harvest trends to your individual property or deer management units/associations.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">AN INTERNATIONAL MEETING OF DEER EXPERTS</h2>
        <p>
            The International Deer Biology Congress (IDBC) meeting is held every four years. 
            In 2018, it took place in Estes Park, Colorado. Attendance was above average with 215 attendees from 19 different countries.
        </p>
        <p>
            The goals of the IDBC are to unite professionals interested in wild deer biology, 
            management and farmed deer production, and to provide a forum to discuss common problems and 
            share knowledge and experiences.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">INDIVIDUAL DEER BEHAVIORS INFLUENCE SURVIVAL</h2>
        <p>
            Deer are individuals just like humans, so we expect deer to behave differently in their selection for resources 
            (food, water and shelter) and how they move, which can influence whether or not they live or die. 
            For wild animals, survival and reproduction are fundamental to population dynamics. 
            However, few studies have linked individual behaviors with the likelihood of survival or reproduction.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">WHITE-TAILED DEER HARVEST ON PUBLIC VS. PRIVATE LAND</h2>
        <p>
            Oklahoma and Texas are composed primarily of private land, which can offer hunters (if provided access) 
            a “refuge” from high hunter densities that are typical of public land hunting.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">HUNTERS ARE IMPACTING WHITE-TAILED DEER BEHAVIOR</h2>
        <p>
            Hunters directly influence population dynamics of white-tailed deer, 
            primarily through harvest, which is the most significant form of deer mortality. 
            Besides direct impacts, hunters also influence deer behavior from their mere presence across the landscape. 
            Bucks changed behavioral patterns such as movement and habitat use to avoid being detected or observed by hunters.
