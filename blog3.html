            In the same way that a human being benefits from having a well-balanced diet, 
            rabbits also benefit greatly from having dietary balance. 
            Rabbits are not particularly high-maintenance when it comes to feeding, 
            but at the same time, it is a good idea to be conscious about what exactly you 
            choose to nourish them with.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">What Vegetables Can Rabbits Eat?</h2>
        <p>
            Rabbits are capable of eating a very wide array of different vegetables, 
            but to make sure that your rabbit has the best degree of balance in its diet, 
            you will want to make sure that the vegetables are varied. 
            No matter what kind of vegetables that you feed your rabbit, 
            you want to make sure that the vegetables are free of any pesticide treatment.
        </p>
        <p>
            No matter what kind of vegetables that you feed your rabbit, make sure that you 
            clean them thoroughly. The more thoroughly that you clean your vegetables, 
            the fewer pesticides that will be able to linger on them when your rabbit eats them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additional vegetables that can be very healthy additions to your rabbit 
            diet include dandelion leaves, collard greens, romaine lettuce and dill. 
            When it comes to the leafy green vegetables that you feed your rabbit, 
            it is important to make sure that you do not feed rabbits iceberg lettuceor cabbage. 
            Darken leafy variations like Romanian are fine, 
            but iceberg lettuce and habits can give rabbits digestion problems.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">What Fruits Can Rabbits Eat?</h2>
        <p>
            In the same way that rabbits can enjoy diet that is rich in diverse vegetables, 
            rabbits can also be fed a generous variety of fruits as well. 
            Due to the fact that fruits have a higher sugar content level than most vegetables,
            it's advisable to be more conservative about how much fruit you feed them comparatively.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though the flesh of the fruit is generally perfectly fine for rabbits to digest, 
            the stones and pits can be highly poisonous and should be kept out of their diet 
            with the same level of diligence that you would exercise in keeping their 
            diets free of pesticides.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rabbits can eat just about any fruit there is but should not be fed the pits or stones. 
            Because fruits have such a high sugary density compared to vegetables, 
            a limit of about two tablespoons a day is advisable for any fruit in your rabbit's diet.
