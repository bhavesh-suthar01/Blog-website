        <p>
            Elephants are the largest land animals on Earth, and they're one of the most unique-looking animals, too. 
            With their characteristic long noses, or trunks; large, floppy ears; and wide, thick legs, there is no other 
            animal with a similar physique.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">African and Asian elephants</h2>
        <p>
            African elephants live in sub-Saharan Africa, the rainforests of Central and West Africa and the Sahel desert in Mali, 
            according to National Geographic. Asian elephants live in Nepal, India and Southeast Asia in scrub forests and rainforests.

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">Elephant life</h2>
        <p>
            Groups of elephants, or herds, follow a matriarchal structure with the eldest female in charge. 
            Herds are composed of primarily female family members and young calves, according to the San Diego Zoo, and include 6 to 20 members depending on the food supply. When the family gets too large, herds often split into smaller groups that stay within the same area.
        </p>
        <p>
            The matriarch relies on her experience and memory to recall where the best spots for food, 
            water are, and where to find protection from the elements. 
            The matriarch is also responsible for teaching the younger members of her family how to socialize with other elephants.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 149, 69)" class="blog-subtitle">Next generation</h2>
        <p>
            Male and female elephants become sexually mature between 8 and 13 years of age. 
            Male elephants will leave their herd around this time, as long as they're able to 
            find their own food and protect themselves, according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. 
            Adult males either live on their own or in small bachelor herds.
