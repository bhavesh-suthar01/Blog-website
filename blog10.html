        <p>Female kangaroos can determine the sex of their offspring and even delay gestation 
            when environmental factors are likely to diminish the chance of their young surviving.

        <p>
            For many people, the Australian outback means only one thing – Kangaroos! 
            These distinctive marsupials can leap 9 m in a single jump, keep their young warm in cosy pouches 
            and live in groups known as mobs. 
            Kangaroos and their relatives are the only animals that use hopping as their primary method of travel 
            but they are unable to walk backwards! Want to know more? Keep reading for our fascinating facts!
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">What do Kangaroos look like?</h2>
        <p>
            Kangaroos have short, soft coats with powerful hind legs, small forelegs, tall ears, large feet and a long tail. 
            The second and third claws on their hind limbs are fused together to create a special claw for grooming, 
            while their forepaws are very dexterous and useful for eating, grooming and defence.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">WWhat family do Kangaroos belong to?</h2>
        <p>
            Kangaroos are marsupials, or pouched mammals. 
            This group is divided into seven different orders, including opossums, bandicoots, koalas and wombats, 
            all characterised by a limited gestation period. 
            Kangaroos belong to the Macropodidae (‘large foot’) family, which has over 60 different species 
            including Kangaroos, wallabies, tree Kangaroos and quokkas.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">Where do Kangaroos live?</h2>
        <p>
            Kangaroos generally live in small groups called ‘mobs’ with around 10 females and their joeys and one or two males. 
            In areas with lots of food though, huge gatherings of around 1500 Kangaroos have been observed!
            Kangaroos typically remain within a small home territory but have been known to travel great distances in times 
            of poor environmental conditions.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">What do Kangaroos eat?</h2>
        <p>
            Kangaroos are herbivores, with a strictly plant-based diet of grasses and flowering plants. 
            They are able to survive without access to water in the dry outback for a considerable time, 
            gaining what little moisture they need from eating succulent plants. 
            Like many other herbivores, including cows, Kangaroos have a complex digestive system that allows 
            them to regurgitate food which can then be broken down to remove more nutrients, a process known as ‘chewing the cud’.
            Kangaroos are typically active at dawn and dusk (this is called being ‘crepuscular’) or at night, 
            spending the majority of their time foraging for food.
        </p>

        <h2 style="color: rgb(235, 69, 97)" class="blog-subtitle">How do Kangaroos communicate?</h2>
        <p>
            Communication varies with species and purpose. Male Kangaroos, for example, make a hissing sound and toss 
            their heads before beginning to fight, which is possibly a way of warning other males!
            Eastern Grey Kangaroos communicate with each other using a gentle clucking noise and will cough when alarmed or angry. 
            Grey Kangaroos signal danger by stamping the ground with their powerful hind legs so that other members of the mob 
            can both hear the warning sound and feel the vibrations of the motion.
            <br>
            Like other species of mammal, Kangaroos are also likely to use chemicals to communicate.
